## Workshops!

The goal of hack401 is to encourage participation in computer science by showcasing fun and engaging projects on different topics. Structured workshops can be invaluable when helping create an engaging and inclusive environment for people of varying abilities and interpersonal connections. A well-planned workshop sets its participants on a course toward learning and delivering a tangible outcome for their time invested. For this first event, we are hosting four workshops around the themes of **virtual reality / augmented reality and music technology**.

### Recreating RI Objects
Participants will create digital versions of objects that are quintessentially Rhode Island and put them in a web page for viewing by all. This workshop will cover 3D space, scanning, the basic components of a 3D recreated object and cleaning a mesh, as well as how to work with 3D objects in HTML using A-frame, an open source framework for building VR experiences into the web. 

### Multitrack Recording in Soundtrap 
This workshop will explore multitrack recording using SoundTrap a collaborative audio workstation. Participants will learn the basics about audio recording (microphones, digital interfaces, signals, volume / gain, panning, mixing) and sequencing (clipping, looping, arranging, editing, layering). These are the basic tools necessary to record your own music, and serves as a great exercise in seeing foundational music technology in action.

### Python Programming for Music 
This workshop will cover the science of sound using the Python, a user friendly programming language. Participants will gain an introduction to Python by working with audio signals, through visualization and manipulation. Computers will be provided – the only requirements are determination and an excitement for music!

### TBD!
It's a surprise! But it will have to do with Virtual Reality and smartphones.
