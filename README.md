## Request for Workshop Proposals

The goal of hack401 is to encourage participation in computer science by showcasing fun and engaging projects on different topics. For this first event, we are seeking workshop proposals around the themes of **virtual reality / augmented reality and music technology**.

Structured workshops can be invaluable when helping create an engaging and inclusive environment for people of varying abilities and interpersonal connections. A well-planned workshop sets its participants on a course toward learning and delivering a tangible outcome for their time invested.
